Ratings and Reviews Application Assignment.

Usage in development environemnt:

1. Clone the project
2. Run npm install

 This should run in local server (Ex: http://localhost/[project-name])
 
 Following default gulp tasks are run when we run npm install:
 1. Build css folder from sass directory
 2. Build 

if you want to trigger the build use "gulp" in cmd prompt.

Everytime a save is performed on the files that you are working on locally, the respective required tasks will run and re-build the css and js folders.

Note: Avoid pushing the node modules and build related files to server.
